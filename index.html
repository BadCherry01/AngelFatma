            Ms.Fatma Khan born and blessed this world with her presence first on 19-06-2002 and in my life in 2021 (hate myself for not remembering the exact date)
            Fatma Khan The most Hottest , Gorgeous , Caring woman one can find on this world , You may think i am overexaggerating a bit but just once look at the image above look at
            the eyes the smile the vibes you can feel , how can one not feel that she is an god's angel and not fall in love with her upon hearing the first sound of her soothing voice
            and many have fallen but she always cared for each one and rejected everyone as politely as possible (coz she is an angel!!!!)
